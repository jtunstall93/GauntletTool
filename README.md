# GauntletTool
A basic tool for assisting beginners in completion of The Gauntlet on OSRS.

The numerical values can be changed as the player collects resources, and as they are changed, the progress bars to the right will fill, indicating how close the player is to required resources for the recommended set up.

The check boxes below can be checked as the player makes/acquires the recommended items for the basic set up. Once all 8 items in the first box are checked and 2 of the 3 items in the weapon attachment column are checked, a text saying "Ready" will appear in the empty space, indicating that you are ready to take on the Hunllef.

Once the player has completed the gauntlet, they can press the reset button. This will reset all numerical values to 0, all progress bars to 0, and all checked items will become unchecked.
